package SuperKeyword;

public class Prog1_P 
//Super	keywords	refer	to	the	objects	of	super	class
// It	 is	 used	 when	 we	 want	 to	 call	 super	 class	 
//variable,	 method	 and	 constructor through	sub	class	object.	
	
//Whenever	super	class	and	sub	class	variable	and method	name	
//	are	same	then	JVM	confused	which	one	to	call	so	to	
//	avoid	this	we	should	use	super	keyword

//1) Variable name are same that time... Here we use super keyword in front of
//   super class variable eg. super.a(superclass variable)
{  //Here we can just declare the variable
        int a=10;
		int b=20;
	    int c=50;
}
